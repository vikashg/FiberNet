1. First use the PreProcessdata folder. 
It creates the train test validation split on the data and also save it in the numpy format so it is easier to read. 

2. Second train the network the training the model. 
There are 3 models essentially 
(a) Conv 16-32 followed by 64-128 nodes
(b) Conv 8-16 followed by 32-64 nodes

3. Predict the results from the trained models: Depending on the training config, use the appropriate model for prediction using the submission scripts 

Once the prediction is done, you will end with text files numbered 1 or 0, 1 being the label for correct fiber and 0 being the label for incorrect fibers. 

Now go back to the volumetric parameterization folder and run Predict_fibers., which will give you the classification. 
Congratulations
